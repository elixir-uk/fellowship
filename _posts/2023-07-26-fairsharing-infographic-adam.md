This factsheet is an introduction to how FAIRsharing supports librarians, trainers and data stewards.

FAIRsharing is a curated, informative and educational resource on data and metadata standards, inter-related to databases and data policies. It guides consumers to discover, select and use these resources with confidence, producers to make their resource more discoverable, more widely adopted and cited, and powers third party tools by providing trustworthy content to promote standards and databases.
