## Training

### RDM-bites
During the ELIXIR-UK DaSH Training Fellowship project, short, bite-sized videos were created to provide overviews and signposting for basic and specialised areas of research data management. Topics vary from data storage to working with sequencing data file types.
These are recommended for anyone working in life sciences, or data management. As the videos are only a few minutes each, it’s possible to watch a whole topic in a short time!

### FAIR Data managment training courses
The courses were developed as part of the ELIXIR-UK DaSH Training Fellowship project, in the format of the Galaxy Training Network and The Carpentries Incubator. These trainings vary in length, approximately 1-3 hours, and can be self-taught, delivered online, or face-to-face. They cover a range of data management best practices when working with data related to clinical studies, DNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, bioimaging, agriculture, machine learning, and other research areas.

### FAIR in (biological) practice – Ed-DaSH
The course has material on FAIR principles as well as RDM best practices. The great thing about this material is that it can be taught face-to-face as part of The Carpentries or be delivered online/on-demand.
You do not need to have prior knowledge of data management to benefit from this course, but familiarity with spreadsheets (such as Excel) and a bio background will be helpful.
This is aimed at researchers who are working in the life sciences, and those who wish to have a better understanding of Open Science and FAIR practices.

### How to FAIR

This online web resource is a fantastic option for those involved with data management across any discipline, it is also a great starting point for novices. Within a few hours, those taking the course will learn the FAIR principles, how to work in line with them and how to improve research data management. It is possible to do this learning in sections, it is not required to complete all the stages together making it even easier for those who need to slot it into busy lives.

## Web resources

### RDMkit
Recommended in the Horizon Europe Program Guide as the “resource for Data Management guidelines and good practices for the Life Sciences”, RDMkit is an open community project that has become the go-to for resources based on best practice and guidelines of FAIR data management in the life sciences.

### FAIR Cookbook
Recommended in the IMI/IHI Project Guidelines and the Horizon Europe Work Programme for Health as the resource for FAIR Data Management guidelines and good practices for the Life Sciences, FAIR Cookbook contains great guidance as well as fantastic examples of data management across all disciplines.
This resource is recommended for any researchers who need to consider data management, as well as data stewards.

### GoFAIR – FAIR Principles
For those wanting to learn about FAIR principles with real data examples, the GoFAIR content is a great starting point. This content takes each letter of FAIR and breaks down those into their individual principles (for example, F has four sub-categories) with explanations of what they mean, why they are important and then real life examples to help connect that learning to actual data work.
This is a fantastic resource for anyone working in the life sciences, especially those who wish to link their learning with examples.

## Visual resources

### FAIRsharing Educational
This collection of infographics and factsheets provides high-level information on a variety of topics relevant to FAIRsharing content across a spectrum of users and in all disciplines. This is an excellent resource with content written by the FAIRsharing team and community champions in the field of FAIR research data management.
